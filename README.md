For the Fairlearn Notebooks always when opening them just run all cells, they are ment to be executed in the corresponding order that the cells are put in. 
The Notebooks already come executed with the results stored so they can be observed without having to run the notebook. But if you want to execute them yourself open them in the corresponding Steps in their labeling (Step 1 - Step 5) and execute them in that order.

Bias Detection and Mitigation Using Microsoft Fairlearn:
This part of the project focuses on bias detection and mitigation using Microsoft Fairlearn, analyzing two datasets: crime statistics and student failure rates. 
The repository is organized to ensure clear documentation and easy navigation.


Repository Structure:

Fairlearn: This folder contains all the code related to bias detection and mitigation.
	Main Code: The primary scripts used for the analysis. (Code from Start to FInish for one example run)
	Code Variations: Alternative versions of the main code, which run with different variables or parameters. (to get different information and results and insights)
	Old Code: Previous iterations of the code, maintained to document the development progress.
	Analysis of initial Tests: Contains 2 Word Documents that Contain the Results of each individual Step from the first full Testrun and document the findings and our interpretations of the resuls.
	Screenshots of some Preliminary Results: Contains Screenshots of some of the Results from the first Iteration of Code. (Results also contained within corresponding Code Notebooks)

Main Code Folder Structure:
Inside the Main Code folder, you will find two subfolders:
	Student Failures: Contains the scripts for analyzing the student failure dataset.
	Crime: Contains the scripts for analyzing the crime statistics dataset.


Within the Main Code Folder is always one Example for each Data-Set performed through 5 Steps (Data Exploration, Cleaning, Analysis, Bias Detection, Bias Mitigation). 
This is performed for one Case to see a full case example. For more different in depth results and analysis we performed multiple different approaches which are saved within the folder of "Code Variations". 
Those are mostly just different Variations in regards to bias detection and mitigation, but because of changes in the approach the code always had to be adjusted a bit.
Furthermore within the Main Code Folder there is one jupyter notebook file that contains a list of all install statements for each library that is required. Run this once in the beginning to ensure all necessary libraries are installed if you plan on running the code yourself.
Also the "Code Variations" contain same code in form of normal python code (without execution output but therefore small filesize) and as juypter notebooks (with execution output but bigger filesize)
