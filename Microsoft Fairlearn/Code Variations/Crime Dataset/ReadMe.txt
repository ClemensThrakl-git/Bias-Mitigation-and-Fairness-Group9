Here are some of the Versions we tested.
The naming shows what/how we tested in that specific notebook.

- One Feature: We only observed a single feature as sensitive feature
- One Feature - Grouped: We only observed a single feature as sensitive feature but grouped it just to see if this would have any impact (it didnÂ´t)
- Combined Feature: We looked at 2 features at once but without grouping them
- Combined Feature - Grouped: We Looked at 2 or more features at once and applied both as a group for the mitigation
- Raw_data: We used the data-set without performing data cleaning on it.
- Iterative Calculation: As a test we always used the results of the previous mitigation calculation for the following calcuation (Debiasing calculated on the results of reweighing for example)
- More Visualizations: Just more visualizations to better understand and compare the results
